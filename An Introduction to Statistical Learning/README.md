## Introduction
The contents in the chapters folders will be made of 2 files: 
- (1) A preview of the jupyter notebook displayed as markdown in the README.md file;
- (2) The jupyter notebook;

This way, one could simply scan the contents in the README, or download the notebook for the right formatting with the latex equations rendered.
