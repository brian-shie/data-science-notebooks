    "### What is Statistical Learning\n",
    "Suppose we have our variable of interest $y$ and a set of features $X$. Statistical learning are tools that helps us to estimate the populational (and sometimes purely theorical) function $y = f(x) + \\varepsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it's not possible to discover the **real** function $f$, we estimate the function with $\\hat{y} = \\hat{f}(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why estimate $f$?\n",
    "- Prediction;\n",
    "- Inference;\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction\n",
    "When we have our features set and want to predict the future values of the response variable. In this case a tradeoff will likely always occur: model interpretability and prediction power.\n",
    "\n",
    "When our estimated $\\hat{f}$ is complex and it's not feasible to understand, we have what it's called a *black box*. In this case the only objective is to maximize the prediction power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When dealing with prediction, even with a theoretical perfect estimate of $f = \\hat{f}$, there will always be some error called _irreductible error_. This error comes from the population function $f$, and per definition, is not a function o the features set $X$.\n",
